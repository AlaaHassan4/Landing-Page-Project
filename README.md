# Landing-Page-Project

This is my first project, and I hope to succeed in using the tools I have learned to implement what is required of me in this project.

I added the sections via JavaScript.

I have created a function to create a link for each section.

The active class properties for both the section and the link have been modified.

I made a button to create additional sections.

I made an icon to go to the top of the page.

I made the icon appear after scaling to 800px.

I made the link header disappear after 8 seconds and reappear with just a swipe.
